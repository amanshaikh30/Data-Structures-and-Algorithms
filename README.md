# Mastering DSA

Welcome to **Mastering DSA**! This repository contains solutions to a wide variety of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems that I've solved using **C**, **C++**, and **Java**. The goal of this repository is to document my learning process, enhance my problem-solving skills, and share useful solutions with others.

In this repository, you'll find problems from several key topics in DSA, each solved using the three languages. These solutions are designed to help you understand the concepts deeply and apply them in coding interviews, competitive programming, and other real-world scenarios.

## Introduction

This repository is a personal project to master DSA by solving problems across multiple languages. It includes solutions for problems of varying difficulty levels, from basic implementations to more advanced algorithms and optimization techniques.

By solving these problems, I have strengthened my understanding of essential DSA topics and honed my coding skills. Whether you're an aspiring software engineer, preparing for coding interviews, or just someone passionate about DSA, this repository can help you improve your knowledge and skills.

## Languages Used

- **C**
- **C++**
- **Java**

Each of these languages offers different features and nuances, which helps me understand how the same algorithm can be implemented efficiently across various programming languages.

## Problem Categories

The problems are organized into several categories to make it easier to navigate and focus on specific topics:

- **Arrays**: Techniques and algorithms to solve problems involving arrays (e.g., searching, sorting, manipulation).
- **Linked Lists**: Solving problems related to singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Implementations and use cases of stacks and queues (e.g., balanced parentheses, reverse Polish notation).
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, tree traversals, and tree-based algorithms.
- **Graphs**: Graph traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS), shortest path algorithms, and graph representations.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementations of various sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Linear Search, Binary Search, and other efficient search techniques.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solutions to problems that can be optimized using dynamic programming (e.g., knapsack, longest common subsequence).
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Problems where greedy techniques can be applied (e.g., coin change, job scheduling).
- **Bit Manipulation**: Solving problems using bit-level operations.
- **Mathematical Algorithms**: Prime number algorithms, GCD, LCM, etc.

## Approach

### Problem Solving Strategy

Each problem is approached methodically with the following steps:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: Carefully read the problem statement and identify the inputs, outputs, and constraints.
2. **Breaking Down the Problem**: Break down the problem into smaller subproblems and identify patterns or existing algorithms that can be applied.
3. **Writing Pseudocode**: Before diving into coding, I often write pseudocode to outline the logic and structure of the solution.
4. **Optimizing the Solution**: Once a solution is implemented, I focus on improving the time complexity and space complexity if needed.
5. **Testing**: I test the solution against various test cases, including edge cases, to ensure its correctness.

This approach helps me tackle problems systematically and build efficient solutions.
